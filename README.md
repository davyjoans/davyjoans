Hi, I’m Cai
- I’m interested in everything. I enjoy mountain biking/cycling, baking, art (both traditional and digital), and working on becoming a web developer.
- I’m currently learning how to create a weather site using JS and API callouts. 
- I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet because I am still learning. Maybe eventually though.
